Dibakar Mushahary,3Good vintage feel and design. But I wouldn't mind paying a bit more for a metal case. Frankly the silver colored plastic casing just looks cheap. and the silver tone of the case and band looks different in color.READ MORE,3,1165.0

Flipkart Customer,"5It's a nice watch, vintage look. But the only problem is the size of the dial. It is pretty small and it should move to category to women's watch rather keeping it men's watch section.

Nilanjan Sinha,"5This watch from Casio is perhaps the best in its kind in the digital watch category. It reminds me of my school days when I used to gape at my friends (the few privileged ones) who were lucky enough to afford this classic masterpiece from Casio.All these years, I have been yearning to possess one, but unfortunately, in the modern age of the Fasttracks and the Rados, this simple yet stylish Casio product had dwindled into oblivion from most of the shops.Thanks to Flipkart for adding this r...READ MORE",5,1165.0

saurabh p,"5Time for some 80/90s to roll back again ;) .Watch looks absolutely cool n retro. Thats surely in the collector's list. Comes with a 2 years warranty and is a steal @rs660. light weight, display is very clear in sunlight.. only thing is the backlight is weak and is just about enough to see at night. A nice case to keep it safely. Just GRAB it if you have a thing for retro watches.Excellent delivery from flipkart.. watch was at doorstep within 2days. As always pleased by their service.READ MORE",5,1165.0

Jaywin Varghese,"4The battery of my previous analog watch which I've been using for the past seven years stopped working, so I needed a cheap watch for replacement. Was pretty surprised to find out Casio still makes these! So, just for old-times sake, I got one. I have been using it for the past week.The watch looks the same (goofy) as ever, if you want the looks, get it only for the retro value. Its very thin and small, smaller than the fat G-Shocks I used to wear as a kid. But it looks fine on my medium-si...READ MORE",4,1165.0
Siva Santhanam,"5Pros: Simple and elegant design, quartz accuracy, alarm and light advantage. I am already using this for past 7 years; didn't require to change battery for last 5 years and still running. The current purchase is for reserving for future use.Cons: The light is somewhat dim; not sufficient to illuminate entire display; backside screws get rusted due to sweat on usage; non rusting screws would be desirableREAD MORE",5,1165.0
