Pratik B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
I purchased this beast at slightly less than 30K INR, for the 64 gig variant, which retailsat around 60K INR . The price had dropped to 43K in the Big Billion Sale days, and I got discount of 11500 INR in exchange  of my two month old Redmi Note  5 Pro along with an additional  discount of 2000 for purchase via SBI Debit card. This phone is at the time being sold at 57900 INR (before exchange discount) on flipkart.As you can understand,  this deal was an absolute bargain and while I was not intending to purchase a mobile as I had recently  purchased one, but I simply couldn't  resist from buying the latest flagship at 50% off!I had some reservations regarding the steep discounts and the fact that this phone had only about 30 ratings here did not help, but I took a leap of faith and boy, did it pay off so well!I am not going to dwell into the many amazing  pros it has, for you can simply  check out hundreds of review videos out there on YouTube.  The only drawback I noticed was the sub par battery life, as it seems to run out of juice in around 11 hours. It helps that it comes with fast charging, that fully charges the phone in around 100 mins.However, I cannot stress enough as to how happy and satisfied I am with this phone, even more so considering I bought it at 50% off!

Bought this phone. Samsung service centre has raised a ticket aftrt checking thoroughly stating that product is defective. Motherboard gone. but Amazon states its own engineers need to check before they pick for return. Can you believe when manufacturer says his product is bad Amazon is creating troubles. My suggestion buy electronic goods through stores. Else you will keep shuttling between Amazon and service centres. A lesson learnt at huge price.

The phone was great. Working perfectly. Smooth, the camera is great, the display too. Worth the 44k I spent. But the box, if observed carefully, it shows how cunningly the seller had reopened this box and resealed this device multiple times. Making it more of a refurbished product than a new one. Kindly check if this happens with you, return it within the due date, otherwise Amazon people will not be helping at all.

It's a great phone. My first Samsung device. Camera is awesome. Battery- Medium power saving mode gives up to 18-20hrs usage with screen on time is 4½-5hrs on LTE.It depends on usage with no heavy gaming. Just fb.insta.whatsap. Hard to get a tempered glass for this S9. 4gb ram is not sufficient for this phone. Display is best.After 8 months usage.Using JioFi always connected for internet.Better battery backup now .Screen on time is still same.Phone has no issues. Really durable.Good to go.

My home button stopped working after 10 days and because of the return policy I am unable to get my phone replaced because amazon refuses to take the phone back and when I contacted Samsung they say it's amazon's problem even though it has a 1 year manufacturer's warranty . I'm stuck with a defective phone that I paid 45k for. Never have I faced such a hell to get a phone replaced. Sold by STPL exclusive

I saw this phone at a store, it's screen was not even on and I got attracted to the black pebble like design. Then i turned the screen on and fell for this beast of a device.I am someone who like compact phone and it had been my main criteria for buying a phone and was using iPhone SE prior to buying S9. After seeing apple kill the 4"" phones and lack of innovation in compact design phones (well maybe Sony being one exception) i decided to buy a flagship with oled and wireless-charging capabilities. I did briefly thought about getting an iphone 7 or 8 but it was too expensive for what tech it was offering. Huawei mate20 pro came close but i got repelled by the notch (I love symmetry).Left with no choice I turned to Samsung devices which i originally hated because of how their performance ages with time but after looking at Galaxy S9, holding and using one, my mind was made up to get a midnight-black Galaxy S9. Sought out all the reviews and articles about the phone on web. They all echoed same things: Best display, better speaker, good camera but bad battery life and many suggesting S9+ over S9 (500mah more juice) but coming from compact phones, S9 itself felt way big of an upgrade for me so I stuck with it. After few days, I happen to find this great deal on Amazon where this seller had put up a black S9 with 64gbs for 43K INR and 2day delivery too!! I thought to myself, I will not get such a deal for sure (well untill S10 is released) and went ahead and booked it.After getting the device, out of the box, it had only 44% battery then i charged it up. after using first couple of days, the overwhelming battery inefficiency undermined all other beautiful design features, amazing screen, stereo speakers which are loud, very good camera and a HEADPHONE JACK. I actually thought of returning/exchanging the phone but kept using it.After using it a week now. I can surely say I made the right decision by buying this phone. Fast charging and wireless charging capabilities masked all the poor battery life and also i started enjoying the beastly performance, vivid colors of this super Amoled screen, with the right size of the screen, it made viewing images/video and reading very comfortable. On top of all this, Samsung's edge display is a head-turner for sure.I wish I could use the phone which a case to show off the solid and neat design of the phone then it would just slide off my hands back to Korea.All in all, this is a great phone, I would recommend to all android users. I hope samsung's upcoming One UI holds up to its expectations (eagerly waiting for the night mode) keeping my fingers crossed that engineers ant Samsung try to make S9 more battery efficient with new updates.Cheers.

This is my second S9. What I like in S9 :-1. Beautiful construction.2. Excellent stereo sound.3. Compact.4. Excellent super slow motion video (enough light required).5. Good day time photography.6. Excellent bundled earphone.7. One UI.Don't like:-1. Obviously Battery, maybe because of android OS or Samsung's OS optimisation.2. Bloatware.3. Front camera ( Quality is not good at all)4. Rear camera at night time

One of the lightest and most user friendly  premium  flagship  phone  from  Samsung. The display  is gorgeous. The design  so economic you  can hold it in one hand  and operate for a very long time. I was divided  between  one plus 6 and galaxy s9  but jumped  the gun when I saw the unbelievable  price at which  Amazon  was selling it. Being  a loyal  prime member  I got early  access to the deal and bought  this beauty at an unbelievable  price. The camera and display  are.the best among  all smartphones  available today. I am not a gamer so for  me the most  important  things were the display  as.i read.a lot on my phone. I also wanted a handy compact  small and lightweight  phone  which  would be  aesthetically  pleasing  and the s9 fulfils all the above  conditions .If you are an avid gamer  you  may try one plus 6.But the truth  be said Samsung galaxy s9  remains  the true flagship  phone  of 2018 and the most  beautiful. Last  but not  least  I must  thank Amazon  for  providing  this flagship  beauty  at an unbelievable  price. The delivery  took only two  days  although  it is the  sale  seasonThank you team Amazon.

Clarity and quality of sound is outstanding. The curved display coupled with the clarity of the vibrant images takes the phone to the next level.Camera is unmatched in performance excellent low light imagery and slo mo feature is too good.Battery endurance could have been better as even after moderate usage and ensuring minimum brightness and apps running the battery doesnt last a day. In fact my other  phone, Samsung Galaxy On Max (more than one year old) gives a full day of battery endurance comfortably after moderate to heavy usage. However, apart from battery endurance of the S 9, balance features more than compensate for this shortcomning.Processor speed is like space age technology. This phone with a 4gb RAM handles data far better and faster tgan devices with 6gb RAM.Worthwhile buy

Have been using Samsung premium phones for 6 years now, my phones have serviced me well over 3 years and I value the build quality and regular updates from Samsung. These phones have provided me good resale value with fair condition I maintain. Have bought this one for my son, who has been on IPhone for last 4 years. He likes the phone and is getting used to Android world. His only option was to buy  a samsung top line if he were to switch from iPhone eco system to Android. If you a 're looking for a premium category don't think twice, close your eyes and buy a premium Samsung. I am also using a 38 months old Samsung Note 5 and hasn't troubled me one single day. Even now it always shows 1.8 GB RAM  free out of 4 GB. I use it extensively for business including social, emails, excel files and tons of other apps. No lag and no hangups. My next one will again be a SAMSUNG.

amazing phone!only 3 downsides I've found after 3 months of using it...1) heavy multitasking is weak because of the limited 4gb of RAM2) UI stutters a little, very rarely!3) display has the usual OLED tint when viewed from side...battery is good for its size, but if battery is one for your primary requirements, skip this one! it lasts one day with light usage but with heavy usage, it'll drain fast.. mid-range phones with weaker processor and bigger battery provide better endurance...also, if you take portrait photography, this one doesn't have the dept sensing live focus effects...leaving these downsides aside, it's a perfect phone for everyday use with very fast and smooth functioning, amazing camera and great display!

Ohk the phone is awesome no doubt about it. First I like to say that through deal and exchange I got it for around 36000 for the 256 gb version that's why it is more awesome and value for money. I have decided to buy one plus 6 but I am not regretting it anyway by buying this instead because this phn might not be a champion in everything (none of the phn in the market are) but you can say it's a jack of all trades. It's almost a full package phnPros-Camera-9/10(pixel is still the winner)Performance 9/10UI- 8/10Display -10/10 (the best in the market)Stereo speaker-9/10Call quality-10/10Water proofHeapphn jackIncludes a sexy akg earphoneWireless chargingI got it for 35000 so value for money for meCons-Finger print sensor- not the fastest-7/10Charging- battery is mediocre-7/10Front camera-7/10Bixby button is annoyingThe phn is a solid performer you won't get the snappy feeling of oneplus or any other stalk android experience with this rather it's fast but some what gentle and mature kind of fast it's follow gently to your finger not like rapidly. If you get this phn for a deal and writhin- 35000 - 42000 it's worth or I else go for oneplusAnd last of all this phn is handy and more usable than other larger device

I was a one plus 5t user so far and purchased this during exchange offer a week ago. After a week use, I am disappointed again(last disappointment  was S7 edge which developed pink lines). The phone heats up for no reason and batter performance is pathetic as it hardly last for half day with mild to moderate usage. Most of the features is worthless without good battery backup as then you have to close most of good features it provide to save battery. Bixby is waste of space and feature in Samsung. I do not see a future or Samsung if they continue to make such bad decisions in their flagship phones. Nite: I have not updated the OS fearing the battery drainage will become worse as I have read from users experience.

Had a dream to buy a current year's flagship, didn't even think of buying it (but S8 on Flip :D) but a couple of days ago b4 buying it in TGIF sale, I saw a great deal on it n I was like wtf?? Thank u so u much Amazon for this miracle... Got it for 37k :)The phone is truly awesome in every way whether u see it's camera, display, multitasking or anything except for its feature called 'selective focus' that sucks with difficult-shaped objects.. I even get good battery life.N for those who want to keep it safe, the best case for it is none other than Rhinoshield's Solidsuit with Carbon fibre. It is just more than terrific! Haven't figured out which tempered glass is suitable for it as whenever I apply any, the touch sensitivity sucks due to its curved screen which should have been flat as I don't think there is any use of it, So using it with PET flim. Overall, one of the best things I have ever bought online.

I have upgraded from OP3 to S9, and boy, it was a great pain to send off the OP3 after 2 years of excellent experience. I had my fears regarding Samsung OS since I am quite used to Oxygen OS. But I was totally impressed by the beautiful UI and thoughtful features (especially edge gestures). The UI transitions seem a little slow, but that can be changed in settings.The phone is not created for the enthusiastic and experimenting developers out there. But it sure impresses anyone who holds it, mainly due to the screen quality and beautiful UI. The camera too is awesome, especially in lowlight due to the changing aperture.But battery life is an issue, it hardly lasts a day with heavy usage and comfortably lasts for the day with moderate usage. Fast charging is a myth in Samsung if one has ever used OP devices. Even wireless charging is quite slow.But overall, it was a steal deal for me since I got it in republic day sale for 32.8K with OP3 exchange offer. For any price more than OP6T it is totally not worth it.

Had problems communicating via calling apps such as whatsapp and facebook messenger. The person on the other side could only hear a crackling noise instead of coherent sentences. Especially during video calls. A quick google search indicates that other people too were facing the same problems. It's rather disappointing that a flagship phonr had such basic issues. Thankfully the product could be returned due to non availability of replacement.

Love the Galaxy S series. Always have been a fan of it cause of the screen quality and the hardware it offers. Samsung always had the best display and now with the awesome camera with slow motion, it is even better (best use the slow motion in brightly lit area). Battery life is excellent but there is lot of bloatware which is always a bit of disappointment for Samsung product.Finally Samsung has adopted the dual speaker thus removing one of its drawbacks. Sound quality is excellent with its dual speaker along with the akg headsets makes this phone a good music box should you choose it.The only disappointment for me is that the speed as I checked my phone in the AnTuTu and got about 24 to 26. Here is hoping that Samsung gets the speed up and it will be one of the best out there.Shout out to Amazon for an excellent offer as I bought the 128gb variant for only 29k.

Absolutely worth for money. Especially the AKG sound effects is just amazing compared to all the other competing phones in the same category. Picture and Speed is up to the mark. Camera not that brilliant as compared to iPhone X.Only demerit I find is the Bixby button (which is unnecessary for most of us) and the battery life when compared to OnePlus 6 or 6T.

To be precise and shortPicture quality: Very goodSound quality: ExcellentBattery life: Extremely poorI cannot believe Samsung is not providing enough battery to handle the hardware this phone has. Cannot even get through the day with a full charge and moderate usage. Samsung's software is also very resource hungry which makes the phone drain faster. Don't even think of having the QHD resolution and adaptive brightness enabled.What were Samsung thinking when they designed this phone.

Simply its a best phone... The only draw back is battery life but you can save that by putting it into ultra power saving mode.One can not compare its camera and display quality with any other manufacturers.I just bought this becuase of its form factor its so easy to access with one hand and no doubt the design is too good. Its bit pricy when you compare with other brands but you can own this if its on Sale for less than 45k.

I got the device for a good prize during the sale. The device hardware is excellent. I like the camera. However, I think Samsung could have used a less heavy UI. The device has features not present in many phones in this range like the headphone jack,and a sd card slot. I think you should compare carefully before buying, and it's definitely not something to buy if you're on a tight budget. You should consider buying if you don't mind paying extra for top quality.

Writing the review after 8 months of use.1. Performance - good. Lack of ram is surely showing its toll my old phones where mi A1 and one plus 3. Compared to them this phone is better than A1 but not as good as oneplus 3.2. Camera - very good.Low light could have been better but still very good camera. Dynamic range is good. Colors are over saturated but still I like it.3. Build quality- top notch.Heee no notch but build quality is very good.4. Display - the best.Samsung s and note series has the best display no complaint here except sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between black and grey. This is a known issue for amoled and oled displays.5. Battery life - below average.I consider average battery as the one which u stand a full business day. So in other words with my moderated to heavy usage I charge the phone 3 times a day. Hence battery life is not good.Overall a decent phone, but now there are better options.

High end games work very smooth. the build quality, UI, and screen are better than 0ne plus anytime. and its waterproof as well.AKG earphones in the box is awesome.

Not sure if my piece is defective or its a problem with the s9 but the phone hangs/slows down a LOT. The screen brightness is terrible and the battery doesnt even last half a day. Very dissapointed. The only positive is the camera

Overall a good performer....Sometimes gets overheated.....very much... That's a really big disadvantage at this specific price point.....Main camera better than iPhone....but Front Camera better in iPhone.....Battery backup is good for a day, not great...Edge screen doesn't have much grip even for skin especially tempered glass

Phone looks premium with fast processor. Camera quality is also excellent. Except for the battery life everything is top notch. Samsung might be playing it safe with smaller battery and slow charger because of those notorious battery fires.

Camera, screen, performance, sound output, build quality & look everything is damn perfect. Battery is a big flop which keeps the phone running just for 10-12 hrs in moderate usage with screen on time of 3hrs. Only relaxation in battery is the fast charger.

Samsung galaxy 8, 9 or the next I guess 10 look all the same. Little differences better camera on the spec sheet. This is my first ever Samsung but it could've been better with a 5000mah battery or at least a 4500mah

Samsung is selling explosive S9 mobile phone which is overheating and about to BLAST. Samsung is making BOMB which can destroy our family if BLAST. Shame on Samsung for making such BOMB.

I got this phone in republic sale for 35k with exchange. And this is worth every penny. I had a onePlus phone. The one UI of Samsung is way better than the oneplus' oxygen os. No issues with the phone so far. Only concern is the battery. Lasts only one day as it is 3000mAh. When it comes to camera quality no phone is better than samsung. It was a good deal and I love this phone

The original cable is replaced with low grade Cable.I was shown original by friend.It is sold on discount and we fall another worry is duplicate battery of phone which I cannot verify.Beware of the fraud.

Quite fluid and best in class. I am adjusting in using an android after continually using iphones. S9 looks to be promising in terms of quality and usability. And anyway, Samsung's camera is awesome!

Screen quality is the most eye catching factor of this device, as samsung has the best screens in the market.Camera is impressive especially the low light photos are the second best after pixel.Stereo sound with dolby atmos sounds like a sweet melody to ur ears... Amazing sound.Battery life is too early to review right now as its been only 2 weeks though i dont have high hopes.

Everything matched to my expectations except a little bit concern on battery backup. Not a great issue. Battery backup is good. But could have been better. And also I am not getting the best out of the camera. Don't know why. May be I need to spend some time with it to use the settings properly.

Can't say much as the phone is awesome I'm every way compact compared to other huge phone and super screen although that's to be expected but one down side is the 🔋 it goes out in the middle of the day as I watch YouTube continuously which is a bummer

Got it for around 43k. It is the absolute best phone in its class. The display is mind blowing and so are the stereo speakers and the build quality. Battery life is sketchy but I've read it gets better with use.Edit: Battery life does not get better. I am getting barely 2:30 hours of screen on time.

Beautiful beast. Super premium hardware. Samsung UI has come a long way since I last used a Samsung phone. There is still bloatware, but some of it can be uninstalled. It's tough to stick a screen guard though due to curved edges.
