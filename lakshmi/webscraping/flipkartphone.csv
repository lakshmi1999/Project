Anshuman Singh,Awesome Mobile....by Samsung.After using one month..... I am writing my review.Pros:1. Screen: Amazing and Best in Market. No one can beat S9 in quality of display.2. Processor: Seamless and Smooth. You can not find any lag. Although phone is equipped with Exynos Processor (Powered by Samsung Custom Mongoose Core) but it handles even heavy tasks smoothly. 3. Battery: Some people complaining the battery backup issue. But overall battery backup is good. There are a lot of services which ...READ MORE,5,26999.0

Narendra Singh Rathore,"Best ever samsung s series mobile phone. S8 is also definitely better but S9 have some advantages 1) Speed either it can reading writing to internal storage or opening apps. 2) Dual speaker setup, it's totally awesome, far better than any samsung s series device. 3) Dual aperture rear camera which have 4k 60 fps, 1080 240 fps and 720 960 fps video recording capability. 4) Little bit better in design also.

Debanjan De,"My reason for choosing Galaxy S9 was to replace iPhone. Pros:Design is extremely handy. Holds very well in the hand.Display is one of the best in the market. Sound quality truly superior. Latest OS Android Oreo.Cons:Battery drains faster than expected. After using this for 2 weeks, battery is the real issue.

arun kumar,After one month of usage I am writing this review! Design : compact for a 5.8 inch phone. It's a pleasure to handle this phone. The curved screen is gorgeous! Performance : since it has top notch specs the performance is very good!I would be happier if they have given 6gb ram! Camera: low light performance is really good because of f1.5 Battery: it lasts a full day with average use. Got screen on time of 6 to 7 hrs. It's OK for  a flagship productREAD MORE,5,26999.0

Pranav,"The phone warms up to temperatures of 47 degrees even in normal usage. The battery doesn't last for more than 4 hours of screen on time. Flipkart is denying replacement as the technician refuses to acknowledge the issue. I bought this phone for its small and comfortable form factor but nothing is worth so much trouble. I recommend you stay away from buying this device. Don't let the sale fool you into buying defective products. Save your hard earned money. Ask me, I've been duped of Rs 28000 !READ MORE",2,26999.0
