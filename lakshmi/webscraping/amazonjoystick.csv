Bought this for my gaming desktop. People who got a concern about the controller’s compatibility with the desktop, let me clarify it is actually a very simple process. “You just have to buy a regular bluetooth dongle (if your desktop doesn’t have in-built bluetooth connectivity).Also, do not install any drivers from the CD which you’ll receive along with the bluetooth dongle, you just need to connect the dongle to your desktop and your windows 10 will automatically install the required softwares/drivers and you are good to go! You can see your xbox controller’s connection in window’s setting > devices.

Terrible support. 90 days warranty. No repair options.My controller failed on day #100. Support recommendation: ""throw it in the trash and buy a new one"".All Microsoft is saying that it does not stand by its products.Buyer beware.

After using it for just 2 months the product has problems firstly Left LB is showing signs of dying secondly just encountered the Left Analog Stick started rolling in the grip area. Overall bad experience as product of such a high price is dying in just 2 months.If there is warranty support or repair support anyone or the seller/Amzon please help.

A great gamepad to buy if you are looking for one. It is compatible with both Win10 PC and Laptops and with the Xbox . You can use it wirelessly by connecting via bluetooth and power source is 2 AA Batteries which comes along with the product later on it can be changed with any aa batteries available in the market & also a chargeable battery with its power cord is available but one have to buy it separately.

I am using it by USB cable and it work flawless in windows 10. It's vibration feedback is awesome. Feel very real. Delivery is very fast with in two days. Services from amazon and cloudtail is getting very good now a days. Bluetooth compatibility is not tested yet. But I assure that Bluetooth Compatibility also work good. Use good Bluetooth device in PC for connectivity in Windows 10(Updated). It also support in ANDROID DEVICE (android pie). So you can play PUBG, SHADOW FIGHT 3. Still using works great. No any problem has been seen yet. If you have any Bluetooth connectivity issue then you should try this:1) Use good SMPS (POWER SUPPLY) like CORSAIR VS450 OR VS550 also Good motherboard.2) You should use windows 10 latest updated OS in PC.

As a user of the previous gen X-Box 360 controller and DualShock 4 I can say that I like this much more than those two. The weight and balance of this controller is perfect, and I'm seamlessly able to connect it with bluetooth with my Desktop and Laptop(Windows 10). The wired connection works good too and the response time is near instantaneous with both.Trigger rumbles are ONLY supported by games bought from windows store.Using approx. 2100mAh Ni-Cd battery is recommended and it should last you for about 4-5 weeks of casual gaming(12-14 hours per week avg. usage).

This was purchased as a discretionary alternative to the black one that came with the Xbox One, especially since it had begun giving me a lot of ""disconnected"" warnings lately. Sure enough, the 3.5mm jack on this one really helps. The black one had a 9-pin adapter type headset, which didn't work even once for me. So I just gave up the idea of interacting on multilayer altogether. It has a matt white finish, so it doesn't attract fingerprints, but in our dusty Gurgaon, every spec of dirt shows up on it. My wife thinks more favourably of wanting to play with the white one, as it's various buttons (RS, LS, RB, LB, LT, RT, A, B, X & Y) are visually more identifyable & she has had a difficult time coordinating with a merged set of black buttons previously. So 5 stars for the wife being able to play 2 player now! Hurrah!

Great packaging from Microsoft. The box included the new Xbox One S controller with 2 batteries. Overall a great experience and the controller is really smooth and the vibration gives good feedback. Plus, it has inbuilt Bluetooth which pairs quickly with your PC(I don't have an Xbox). A great buy , you have to purchase it to believe it. Probably the best controller for PC gaming.

This controller is one of the best looking controllers i have purchased and trust me when i say this but i have purchased a lot of controllers.Shipping and handling - No complains from me.Working of the controller - The controller works amazing. Yes the battery will drain out quickly since it uses Bluetooth connection to connect to your pc but when i say quickly i mean around 7-8 hours. I would recommend getting Duracell batteries instead of the normal Eveready batteries with which the controller lasts for around 3-4 hours or maximum of 5.If you face any issues- I bought the controller and found that the A button kept getting stuck. So i contacted Amazon and thet told me they cannot do anything since it's a non refundable and non replaceable product and asked me to contact Microsoft. Before doing that i tried one of the tips from YouTube that suggested me to rub some Rubbing alcohol on the buttons. Since i couldn't find the liquid one, i got the alcohol swab(It's much easier to find the swab than the liquid here). Anyways i did what i was told and yes the button went back to normal. Is it a permanent fix? Don't know, but if it works why not just keep doing that instead of waiting for a reply from Microsoft.What to do if you face this issue?I would suggest doing the same thing as i did and rub some Rubbing alcohol or swab on the buttons, clean them and see if it works. If it doesn't fix the issue for you, then you can contact Microsoft. No point in contacting Amazon as the product clearly states it's not refundable.Now for the real question, should you buy this?My answer - Yes! Definitely. If you have the money and wanna try it go for it. It's Highly unlikely that you'll get a faulty product this day but even if you do, contact Microsoft (when i say faulty, i mean completely bricked controller), otherwise you can try the method i have mentioned above or you can simply just go for the Red Gear controller. But having used the Red Gear and many many more controllers, i am guaranteeing you, this is the one you want if you can buy it.Take it easyThanks

I was confused what I should buy when I was looking for controllers. I usually play TPP games like the ones from the Assassin's creed series, Batman: Arkham series, GTA 5,  Middle Earth series, etc.I was confused between this one and the ones offered by Logitech. Having owned a Logitech F310 before I was happy with Logitech products but not completely satisfied.The Xone controller really hit that spot and left me in awe right from the first moment I picked it up. Some people don't like the design but I believe it's great for long hours of gaming. The triggers are very smooth but I wish they had a setting that enabled the users to toggle between range input and click input - that part really gets annoying when you're playing a shooter and don't really need the range input.Overall I rate this 8/10. Got what I paid for.

There is no doubt regarding the quality of the controller. Buttons are very responsive, the shape and design makes it easier to hold the controller for longer periods without any kind of discomfort. I am using the inbuilt bluetooth on my laptop (Windows 10.1) to connect the controller.But the packaging was pathetic.

Zero hassles while playing on a Windows 10 PC. The controller itself is sturdy, palm-fitting and well-weighted. Sticks are smooth and buttons are nice and tactile. The rumble is also sharp and lovely. But really the best feature is the trigger. Playing Shadow of Mordor is a dream using this controller, and the triggers just feel right for using the bow/stealth. Bluetooth is also a breeze - just turn the controller on and it pairs automatically (I only had to re-pair it one time). All all an amazing controller, much better than the 360 one. A little expensive but a worthy investment.

Coming from a Redgear wired (Xbox 360 layout) controller, this was a massive upgrade. The controller has even weight, the build is solid, the sticks feel amazing, the triggers are nice (have their own vibration motors and feel great), the texture also has a very nice matte finish, which feels great in the hand. Overall, a lovely controller which I feel is worth the money.I had initially written how the one major flaw that the controller had was inability to reconnect to the PC, but that no longer seems to be a problem, it connects as soon as I turn the controller on. I am unsure of what happened earlier and why I had to reconnect every time I had to use it, but as long it works here on, I have no complaints.PS: The provided 3.5mm headphone jack only work through Micro USB, it does not work over Bluetooth!

I use this with my desktop (you will need a bluetooth adapter if your desktop doesn't have Bluetooth) and it was easy to pair in Windows 10. Once you're paired, you can turn this on and off whenever and it will connect to your system automatically.Battery life is really long with good batteries (duracell). I think I've gotten through 4-5 days with a lot of usage, so my estimate is around 30+ hours. I'd recommend getting rechargable AAs though, these don't last as long (±20 hours) but you won't need to keep buying new batteries every other week.In terms of performance, I've used it to play Forza, Monster Hunter, Witcher, FIFA and a whole bunch of other games, and it works the best out of any other controllers I've used with PC. Force feedback is pretty on-point in Forza. The analog sticks may take some getting used to due to the unconventional layout, but if you're an Xbox gamer you should have no issues.The PS4 Dualshocks are almost as good, but they're a pain to set up with Windows and honestly not worth the trouble for most people. If you need a controller that is well-built and easy to set up and use, just buy this.

I have owned two Xbox controllers before. One has a thumstick drift issue while the other has a broken bumper. The latter is still usable in every aspect just by fixing it with a tape. Both worked for almost two years without any issues and they still do. And both were black.This is my third Xbox controller. A white controller looks much better when compared to a standard black one. The overall built quality is good except the bumpers. Works great even with PC. Any micro USB cable can be used to connect it with a PC. Negligible lag when connected using Bluetooth. There is a 3.5 mm jack which can be used for listening to game audio and also for multiplayer chat. Haven't tried with any Android device but will update my review later.

As an owner of multiple XBOX One controllers from different regions, I can say that this is absolutely genuine and legit. This is the latest iteration/version with the built-in Bluetooth and 3.5mm headphone jack.Packaging: The packaging was done right. The best part was that 2 AA batteries were included in the packaging. Props for that.Quality: The controller is very well-built, it will take thousands of hours of your gaming sessions like a beast, of course provided that you aren't throwing it around every hour or so. With that said, it is very durable as well, it can take a few falls or throws (I have experienced it, LOL). I'd recommend you to get a silicone cover as I have to increase the longevity, preserve the look, and add some grip to the controllerConnectivity/Compatibility: Wired connectivity is not an issue with any of the Windows versions. However, wireless connectivity with Windows 10 is native (automatically supported, drivers downloaded and installed, games automatically detect and configure), but requires a little tweaking (manually installing drivers, tweaking c360 settings for each game) with Windows 7. I used to have Windows 7 when I got this, but when I got to Windows 10, it was absolute heaven as all games directly and automatically started detecting the controller and if the controller went to sleep and was woken up again, it seamlessly connected with the system again. It is highly recommended you get Windows 10 for this, it is well worth it3.5mm Jack: The audio through the 3.5mm jack is just as it should be, it is very good. Although, you can only use headphones with the controller when your controller is in a wired connection with your system. When your controller is wirelessly connected to the system, the headphones won't work. Wireless connection + headphones support is only there for using with an XBOX OneUPDATE: I have had this controller for 2 years now. Still works, feels and looks the same as day one. Microsoft doesn't play games (LOL).

The controller is as good as it looks in the picture. To the peoples who think that it comes with a rechargeable batteries then they are wrong. This controller comes with 2AA Duracell batteries and which are NON-RECHARGEABLE. You can use any 2AA batteries to power this controller or you can power it using the usb cable. You just need to connect it once to your windows 10 PC and then after that you just need keep the Bluetooth switched on in your PC and when you start the controller it will connect automatically. The main point is the force feedback. This controller has a very good force feedback compared to the older Xbox controller and compared to other normal controllers. Also, buttons and sticks are smooth to a great extend. The only problem is the weight of the controller but that’s the price I think anyone can live with. Overall, a great product to use money on.

Rohit,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
This product is good in quality but main issue is there is no power cable provided, u have to buy separately, if you use AA batteries then to complete a whole video game ex, ASSASIN CREED ODYSSEY u have to spend 500 rs or more on batteries to complete play on batteriesSecond thing no Bluetooth adaptor provided so u have to buy a 4.0 Bluetooth too which costs 400 rs approx. Overall to operate this remote becomes costly.Another thing that I noticed when u start the PC it very easily connects WITH PC  but if accidently disconnects during gameplay then if not easily connected... Sometimes it takes 10-15 minutes to reconnect and sometimes u have to restart the computer. But build quality is good and overall performance is good

I know for some people this one can be real pricy, but take a look and compare this controller with the Logitech one and you’ll find that it has much better feedback and really nice vibration feedback. But let’s just put all it to a side and let me tell you what I felt about using this controller after a week. First things first, thanks to amazon for delivering this product really fast. Now one major problem with the controller is that it’s very slippery. Although being made out of plastic it does have some weight to it but the material used on the body is very slippery to hold, but you can just get an Xbox cover right away from amazon which will probably not cost you more than 300 Rs. beyond all that the feedback from this controller is really impressive and ofcourse the vibration feedback too. Despite having such a comfort design, one other problem which I faced was to setting it up to Bluetooth. Now Microsoft does provide you two Duracell batteries inside the box, but it doesn’t work all the time when put inside the controller. But I managed to start up the Bluetooth issue.This is one best controller you can own.

I bought this as upgrade to my existing Xbox 360 controller which I was using to play on the PC (Rocket league, Witcher, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, Trials Fusion, Street Fighter V). I prefer the XBox thumbstick layout (which is asymmetrical) to the PS thumbstick layout (which is symmetrical) . So when my Xbox 360 controller started having issues I naturally wanted the Xbox One controller.The controller works really well and I was used to it within a few days. The Xbox 360 controller was very well made and the Xbox One Controller maintains the quality. Buttons are crisp, responsive and easy to press. The controller itself is very comfortable to hold and has a great grip. I'm hardly thinking about the controller when playing -- which means that it works well and responds really well.For some reason I wasn't able to pair the controller with the PC via Bluetooth. The PC sees the device but refuses to pair with it (this is a Win10 PC with latest updates). However, I had a spare micro USB cable lying around and it works perfectly with that. Now I don't need to worry about batteries :).All in all, a great product.

It is a nice looking controller and feels good in the hand and was good till it worked but the left thumbstick drifts back to the left when trying to point to right within one month of buying it. Cannot really recommend it at all. Most of the Xbox controller's I have used in the last 3 years have not been well made at all(including Elite controller which did not even last one year) but this one has been the least durable. I really think I would move over to Playstation in the future because Microsoft can't seem to make a single durable controller.

One of the best wireless controller out there in market. Blutooth connectivity is very simple as described (inbuilt bluetooth or else bluetooth dongle will get the job done on your PC). Range of bluetooth is good enough, that you can easily sit on your couch and play from far without any latency. You can even use micro usb cable to plug and play. Coming to the product I would say coming from logitech F510 controller to Xbox feels a bit different, while within 2-3 days you will get used to it. The grip is firm and the buttons are tactile. As far as batteries are concerned I purached Duracell 1200mah rechargeable batteries (got it for 300 bucks pack of 4 :D). These batteries normally gives backup of approx. 25-30 hrs for me (I normally play around 4-5 hrs a day). Also please remember the 3.5mm audio jack provided on controller works only with some earphones/headphones, if the jack really matters to you. Last but not least got this product at 3k at Amazon's great Indian festival. Highly recommended!!!

These stars are just for the performance. It's really good. Analogue sticks are smooth unlike the 360 controllers and also buttons feel clicky. But, to my dissapointment, xbox does not provide warranty for their accessories. Just as a consolation, they provide 90 days warranty. I bought this and used for just 5 months. The buttons somehow stopped working.when i contacted xbox support they refused service as it was more than 90 days old. Hence, if u wanna save money and want to play games on pc only, go for logitech controllers. They are far better and also provide warranty.

The controller is great if you are a pc gamer. I have ps4 and ds4 with it, so i used to play games with ds4 using ds4windows app. Well dualshock 4 is better than xb1 controller Because ds4 has inbuilt battery and its cheaper too. But this controller is compatible with all games ( like arkham Knight, sekiro etc.) and button prompt showing are xb1 controller's. You can play wired by using usb cable, but if you buy extra rechargeable batteries and charger for it then your collection is completed.Pros1. Comfortable and feels great in hands.2. Compatible with all games on pc.3. Easy to connect with pc.4. It's value for money if you compare it with msi, steam or asus controllers.Cons1. Doesn't has battery in it.2. Expensive than ds4 even though ds4 has inbuilt battery3. Buying extra rechargeable batteries and charger for it makes it 1.5 time expensive than ds4.4. Doesn't include usb cable with it.

I was like just taken aback by their attitude towards customers who invested 4000 INR and it's just a piece of plastic now. I ain't new to controllers as my both PS4 controllers work flawlessly from past 3 years.

I'm not sure if I received a genuine product but I'm quite disappointed with the new controller. The quality is not a good as my old Xbox 360 Controller, the plastic feels fragile and the XYAB (face buttons) feels way softer than my old Xbox 360 Controller, it feel as if the button are button are going to get stuck and makes a clacking noises whenever I press the buttons and the vibration feels a little broken sometimes when it vibrates hard. And the controller being a little expensive over the Xbox 360 Controller I expected a better quality from Microsoft but it kind of feels cheap. I would prefer a Xbox 360 Controller any day.

I bought it for pc gaming. This one comes with bluetooth but do remember YOU NEED A BLUETOOTH 4.0 OR HIGHER TO CONNECT.I have a ps4 controller as well as this but this one is far superior due to the fact that it does not require any third party software. Use it with Bluetooth or a micro USB cable

xBox Controllers are the best for gaming because of the grip and comfort they offer. Everything is placed perfectly! The joystick is closer to the thumbs as all games now are played on joysticks and not arrow keys. The PlayStation DualShock Controllers are not ideal for the grip and comfort so the third party companies make xBox like PlayStation controllers.

If you're confused between choosing a wireless controller or wire controller. You should definitely go for the wireless one. One push of a button & there you go. Lately i have been playing Fifa 19 and i kind of felt that the direction button sometime dosen't work properly. Other than that its a good product. Also you can go for the PS4 pro controller if you want a lil smaller.

The only controller worth buying. Perfect for pc gaming. Don't worry about the price. I have used other budget controllers_(priced around Rs. 2000) but they all malfunctioned after a short time. The best feature is that it runs on both batteries and can be operated connected to the pc using a usb cable.

If you are a pc gamer and you want to play pc games with a controller then this the one U need to go to...It's easy to connect looks amazing and the experience is amazing. Though PC gamers prefer keyboard and mouse but I bet once you use this there no going back.

Nice controller, best triggers in any controller, best ergonomics in any controller. The bumper buttons are fragile, both of my xbox one s controllers have broken bumper buttons, and I'm not a rough user at all, I use em with care, but the trigger mechanics in fhe bumper button just sucks, the plastic is fragile. Overall great controller.

Battery drains often. Otherwise the best controller out there. Works with any PC game and does not need any separate bluetooth dongle/reciever to work. Just press the small button on the top and it automatically connects to your PC. Must buy for every gamer.

This product is not working properly very sad after paying and within a week it's spoiltOnce we attach the headset the other person cannot hear us.Initially we  thought it's a fault' with our headset that's why didn't ask for returns so yesterday I purchased a new wireless gaming set but facing the same issue. In the online gaming games the opposite person cannot hear usCan something be done

I loved everything about this controller: I wanted a white editionBut the only issue is the Trigger Motors make noises while vibrating (It's an audible sound not like the normal sound of xbox motors)I don't know if it may be happening due to lack of space between plastic body and motorApart from these...…..I loved it <3

Best controller ever. Genuine product from amazon and fast delivery. If you dont have bluetooth compatibility in your desktop PC just connect your controller with a micro USB cable which you use to charge your phone. No battery required if played by wired connection. No drivers required to be downloaded. I'm using windows 10 and its just plug and play. Microsoft will automatically download the drivers. Very easy to connect and amazing product.

Been using it for a month.. No issues so far .Only drawback is that is not rechargeable and we have to keep on changing batteries or buy rechargeable batteries. The recharge kit of Xbox cost around another 3000(which is really expensive in my opinion). Otherwise all is well.

It fits seamlessly into hands and is quite comfortable. It's lightweight and I've played hours without tiring. Just plug and play, no need for any installation.
