This one's a classic. Styles may come and go this Vintage Casio will always have its own ardent followers. I am love understated but high on performance watches and  this fits the bill. I received prompt delivery by seller Crystalarc Lifestyle and the piece was packed properly. In fact I got one from a relatively new manufactured batch.

Awesome feel of a vintage watch. For people who are 35+ brings back memories of childhood. Thanks to Casio to have made it so nice and affordable. Good display and strap. But people looking for big watches- beware, this is small size in line with the vintage timeline of design.

Looks like a pretty decent purchase.Pros-1-Looks like a pretty decent vintage watch.2-Very light weight so you wouldn't even care about it.3-Digital display is decent.Cons-1-If you have lot of hair on your hands then the steel strap might end up pulling your hair.2-Illuminator is crap.3-The case is NOT made of steel, it has stainless steel back and steel band. THE CASE IS OF PLASTIC.Overall decent purchase, if you want a decent digital watch with retro looks and low cost go for it.

Arun,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Fantastic watch. Reminds me of my childhood. I used to wear this on exam day. Being full body metal, it suits outdoor activities. I have pasted an adhesive tape on the top of the watch, to prevent scratches! This is the cheapest way to protect your watch. I would recommend this method for everyone who wants to use it for a long time.

A classic. The stainless steel feel and durability. I am using this watch from more than 20 years. It does last upto 7 years. Simplicity at its best. If you use it carefully, it will last years. A thoroughly great watch for people who love simplicity. Amazon delivered well before time.

Extremely wise on the part of Casio to bring vintage back into for, this is an inexpensive yet super cool watch and I have everyone skiing me what's did I pick this up from, since it evokes great memories of times gone by.I think one should buy it for its sheer vintage value really.

JOYDEEP GOSWAMI,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
I was looking for this item for quite some time out of sheer nostalgia. I checked with some genuine Casio shops, but none had it. One day in the first week of Nov 2018, I decided to give it a try on 'Search' on Amazon, and to my surprise and utter delight - there it was! There were 382 reviews about the item and highly positive. People who bought it, did for the same reason that I was looking for - to remind me of the memories of school days! It is  an excellent product, exactly as described and true to its image. A must buy at such a dirt - cheap rate. Highly recommended!

Really love this watch cool vintage and stylish for those who have a skinny wrist should try this. This watch is super minimal with a really cool design downside is it get scratch easily so if you are a desktop person should avoid wearing the watch during the working on a desk. I wasn't Into watches earlier reason being I have a watch which was too bulky I never felt comfortable wearing that its about 40-44 mm dial size which is very big according to my wrist size. It is easily returnable. Cheap and best option.

I ordered women’s watch in this edition, however the size was wayy too small and also it was in gold. So I returned it and ordered men’s watch. I like the size of it, not too small, not too big, perfect for everyday casual looks. It definitely is vintage and looks pretty decent too

It's an awesome watch and a classic one. Being a 90's kid it reminds me of late 90's when wearing such digital watches made me look cool among others. the price is okay, it has a small dial which most people may dislike but if you want to cherish your young days add this in your collection

Saajan Roy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
This watch is very good for regular usage.The weight of this watch is not much and that's why it feels very comfortable to use.I bought this watch because of its size.Almost every digital watch have a big dial but this watch don't.The small dial is perfect to see the time and because it is available with chain belt it looks also good.I don't think there are many wrist watch models available like this one.It is water resistant also but only for raining or splash of water purpose as mentioned in the box user manual and on the watch body.I didn't tried this watch while swimming so I don't know if it will survive on that or not.But in raining it survived.Time and date and which day is today functions works fine.The light is also good as it can show the time in a completely dark environment.I have brought this with Rs. 1165.I will not say that the watch is a value for money product because this watch model is very old and features are also not so much, but considering the 2 year warranty, longer lifespan, adequate weight, slim and stylish design with chain I like this watch and I brought one.I am happy using this watch.

Dumesh Nair,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Nostalgia at its best. The hourly timer is one feature I missed the most in the new watches. Otherwise it is one basic watch which does what it does best, tells time!!And it’s really water resistant I bathed my kids wearing it and didn’t even realise it and it still functions like a charm.

Waseem,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
So I've got this a few days ago and WOW! Does this watch live up to the hype! Really very water resistant! Is built like a tank and works well! Although if you want a proper light, don't go for this. If you want a durable watch which looks good and can bear rough use!At first I'd received a defected watch, the second time I got something totally different and then right the next day I got the replacement, so kudos to Amazon for such quick service!

This is an iconic watch right here. Everyone from Obama to Osama has worn it at some point in their lives. You can see this watch in action in any 80's show out there (and even Narcos if you watch closely)It's inexpensive,reliable and a timeless classic that will never fade! It's a must have for everyone. The value for money on this alone is a reason for you to buy it right now!

Vivek M Nair,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
Worth the money. It has all features required for daily use. The glass doesn't get scratched easily and the strap is light yet strong. Love the hourly alert feature. Only downside is the backlit which illuminates only from the left side and doesn't have a timeout (it'll glow only for the duration of button press).

Best product in this price range, top notch quality control afterall it's a Casio.If your budget is under 2k you can blindly opt for this cult piece. This watch design goes well with sports as well as formal dresses and it's very light weight and also extremely water resistant.I have two Fastrack and one titan watch as well but the quality and simplicity this watch provides is beyond any other brand's watches.In brief: Loved it extremely 😍😍😍😍😍

I had to return the watch since it has only 30mm dial. Not for people with big wrist size. The strap feels weaker and cheap since the watch is very lightweight. Apart from this, it's a good watch. Would've kept it if it had a bigger dial size.

Makes you feel nostalgic and reminds you of the good old days in college when these type of watches were a rage.For some, the dial would seem fairly small as compared to today's big dial watches.
