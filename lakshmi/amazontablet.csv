Perfect product for your day to day tasks if you are not into heavy editing and stuffs. The new ipad os 13 just makes the ipad a sweet dealPros1) display. It is an excellent display. A lot of people compare it to the more expensive ipads for the no airgap display. But for yhe size and price it is better than a lot of laptops also. Plus the resolution remains the same as bigger ipads2) sound amazing sounding speakers though only one sided, not a surround sound. But the sound quality is great3) battery life. Lasts for 3 to 4 days without charging for my usage4) ipad os. Makes it super convinient for many things in which u needed a laptop. This is replaced my laptop to the most of extents. Barring a few thingsConsA10 chip. Its not a slow chip. But yes for the fact of future proofing. I think 2 to 3 years down the line apple will stop updating for this chipStorage. 32 gb base in todays time is too less. Should have been 64 atleast. Plus upgrade costs a bomb bringing it closer to ipad air4g models costs a wopping 11k more. Thats a crazy asking price for the sameCameras. They r the worst cameras for 2019 hands down. The front camera of 1.2 mp doesnot feel good for video calls alsoAccessories. Apple accessories cost a bomb. The key board cover is around 13k, apple pencil for like 8k.Overall very satisfied with the product for the use that i have.

4 star because no update for camera. 1.2 mp is not enough for selfie and  calling. Rest might be good. let us see what happenes. waiting for the launch...

I will only list the cons, as all remaining aspects of this device are pros.1.Front Camera is underwhelming, rear camera is average. Same camera setup as of iPad 6th Gen.2.The chipset is still A10 Fusion (same as iPad 6th Gen), and the call it iPad 7th Gen :/ Altleast they should have given A11 Bionic or A10 X chipset(as giving A12 Bionic would put it in the same category as of iPad Air 3/iPad Air 2019).Rest all are Pros.So overall 4 stars, 1 star less for not changing the SoC, which is the heart of a device.It is basically iPad 6th Gen, with a (slightly) bigger 10.2 inch Retina HD screen(I can’t differentiate between this iPad’s screen and iPad 6th Generation’s screen though, in terms of quality), 1 extra gigabyte of RAM, and Magnetic connectors at the right side (to connect 1st Gen Apple iPad Keyboard).P.S.: If you get the iPad 6th Gen for 22K or lower, go for it, you won’t regret. The only significant compromise you will be making is the loss of 2 years of software updates, but the amount of money you will be saving is worth the compromise.P.S.: There are lot of cases available for iPads on Amazon and Flipkart, but most of them are of bad quality (yes, even the expensive ones). So, I would suggest you to buy the case by following method on Amazon (or maybe on Flipkart as well)-1.Search, ‘iPad (model/generation) case with Pencil holder’.2. In the search result, you will also see the one made by Robustrion, having a marble colour on the lid. Go for that one.The reason of me recommending a case is because, I previously had purchased a case for my iPad 6th Gen (which was more expensive than the one made by Robustrion, and didn’t have Pencil holder as well). Initial impressions were good, but after few months, the magnets stopped waking up the iPad (turned out that the magnets didn’t put back the iPad back to sleep as they were defective, but since it was my first iPad, I didn’t notice it) and within a year, despite handling carefully, it ripped off really badly, as if it were used very roughly. Also, the internal fabric of the case, despite being soft, left a scar (caused by slight fading of rose gold colour) on my iPad. Then I immediately switched to this case, and it’s far better than my previous iPad case.P.S.:If the case you have purchased is perfectly alright, with magnets working properly, the ‘Lock/Unlock’ option under the ‘Display and Brightness’ tab in settings will become visible, otherwise it won’t. So as soon as you buy your case, check this setting ASAP.

I wanted to buy a laptop for my research work. So I wanted to buy a laptop with a decent and recent processor, SSD and MS Office loaded in it. No laptop could qualify even after going after AMD latest variants.Suddenly Apple promoted notification on the Amazon itself led me consider for iPad.After lot of deliberation I decided to embark on the journey into the Apple world. It's very interesting and exciting platform. It's like ditching Railways for Air travel.All the software are available in Apps. No breakdown of OS and No requirements of Antivirus. Fully safe and secure environment along with super speed processor. The Audio and video is crisp and smooth.Must have gadget for every home, Students and Professionals.

Wow! this will be my second product from iOS and trust me it gives the premium feel !P.S. I am avid user of android, Windows pc and iPhone all the platforms.Now back to the product I purchased it for a normal online entertainment as it was not feeling good to watch movies in mobile and everytime to switch on the laptop was also not soothing also, a little bit of excel and word documentation which can be done with Google apps and Bluetooth keyboard.Pros- Superb display and sound- Excellent game handling capacity- Comparing to Samsung Tab A its almost double the price but the smooth transition it provides is unmatched.- No lags- Headphone jack is there !Cons- Data transfer from Android or Windows PC is a bit lengthy or unconventional as I am used to android it takes lots of tips and tricks for doing it.- accessories are costly but it also gives you the best in market- Costing increases for more GB or 4G versions- Camera is a downside for 2019 but who buys an iPad for camera anyways if apple will upgrade the camera the cost will increase which I don't want personally ... :)So if you're looking for some good fun and entertainment plus small documentation and design work this one's for you but# If budget is important and it's just for casual entertainment then go for Samsung Tab A# If storage matters go for higher GB version# If you want pc like speed and hardcore design work better go for iPad pro !For any questions plz feel free to contact on my Instagram or FB pageInsta/FB : IemMihirAnd for unboxing video on this one you can visit my YouTube channel (Link is in Bio)@IemMihirThanx :)

7 Th generation iPad from Apple computer is very fast. It has A10 Fusion chip with 64‑bit architecture and Embedded M10 co processor with 3GB ram. It is very useful to watch online video and search internet on the move. Many times this little device is replacing i7 desktop computer. I am using WiFi and Bluetooth version of this tablet computer. This little device only consume approx. 10W of power(when charging) where as a basic desktop computer consume 180 - 250 W of power. Only trouble I felt with this tablet computer is storage. I hope in near future it will be resolved. Battery back up approx. 10 hour with continuous use. Thank you very much.

Amazing ipad if you are student and you use it for study, notes taking, watching videos, playing games and web surfing.Wit bigger screen and good back covers, it almost replaces a laptop. Apple pencil support and wireless keyboard support just places it near to pro lining of iPads.Thanks.

a good product for all homely stuff- watching movies, games, child friendly, editing and basic office stuff can be done. this is a good option for a laptop since it has keypad compatibility and pencil support.go for this value for money product. It can be argued that other brands have much better stuff than this one and at much lower cost. The usual apple argument. But to be fair to apple and particularly this product- the seamless interface, updated ios, ease of use, high power processor makes this a top notch product for sure. Dont miss this one, especially if this is on sale or no cost emi..

Amazing delivery by Amazon as usual. If you want to buy a tab for first time, this is for you. I have used a lot of tabs before but never owned any so, I had a fair knowledge of what I was getting into. Simply i don't want to list out the pro's which you already know. So I am going to give out the con's.1. Screen is not laminated (Hardly you will notice that in day to day life, but buy the grey one. That helps in blending of the screen gap)2. Memory is only 32GB, I mean c'mon. But IOS 13 supports external SSD(so hurray!, but please don't buy physical hard drive to extend. It won't work)3. Little bit of glaring when viewed through slant angles. So that's a bummer sometimes also outdoors but it's ok!.

Well, it's my first apple product so I'm really excited for this iPad.The features are really amazing, and being an entry level iPad it's giving some amazing specifications.Really worthy, and helpful for students and professionals.The OS 13.3 makes it run smoothly and efficiently, and multitasking is allowed which is a plus point.It's light weight and the 10.2 large screen is awesome to watch videos and do important stuffs.

I purchased a 32gb space grey 7th gen model. After using it for 2-3 days I noticed a battery problem. It took around 9-10 hours to completely charge the battery but the backup was good.. So I placed a replacement order and got a call from an amazon expert. He placed a replacement order for me and yesterday I got a new ipad and I returned the faulty one. Now in this ipad battery is Good. If you purchase this ipad  there is a very little chance that you may face such inconvenience. Always take 2-3 days to check the product up to your marks and if there is some fault or anything just return or replace it.This was my experience but overall I knew that the new Ipad will be okay. Amazon customer service is quite good.

Apple iPad is an awesome product. The overall use of the product is very good and it's user-friendly. The main drawback is that storage space is 32 GB and cannot be expandable. At least as we expect 64 GB minimum for storage. Apart from that its lightweight, camera quality is average and there is no flash provided at the end. Battery charging takes bit long time to complete.

Great experience with this ipad, it is my first device from apple. How good may they charge you but they sure provide quality. 32 gb is good for study purpose and 5 gb from i cloud, we can use Google drive space too. You can use Kindle books for reading. There is so ease in reading, we can edit pdf according to our need.
